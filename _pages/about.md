Personal experience

I am currently an undergraduate student majoring in software engineering and cloud computing. I am studying at Putian University and have a strong interest in the field of computer vision. I also have some research on object detection in computer vision.

I have been involved in Faster RCNN algorithm, SSD algorithm, and YOLO algorithms such as YOLOV7 and YOLOV5 for object detection.

Now, my main focus is on improving the YOLOv7 algorithm (especially YOLOV7 Tiny, which is more edge GPU friendly).

Generally, I use CPU and GPU for training.

I have rich experimental experience and strong improvement ability on datasets of various categories and scenarios, such as wildfires, cells, aviation, polyps, road pits, smoke, etc.

Usually, I will change the network structure on the backbone and head, replace more suitable convolutional blocks on the Neck layer of the network, replace activation functions that are more suitable for the network, replace different loss functions, replace different detection heads, replace pooling layers with different receptive fields, replace NMS, change the interpolation method of the up and down sampling layers, and add attention mechanisms at different positions in the network Start improving the network by replacing anchor box clustering algorithms and other methods.

I am a proactive and communicative person. I am willing to accept different opinions as long as you are willing to raise them, and I would be more willing to communicate with people with the same mindset. If you are willing to communicate with me, please feel free to send me an email.
